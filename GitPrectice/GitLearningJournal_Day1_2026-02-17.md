### What I Learned Today

I learned a git command `git --version` today.

**What it does:**
- This command shows the installed version of Git on my system
- It helps verify that Git is properly installed and accessible from the command line

**Example:**
```bash
git --version
```

**Output:**
```
git version 2.XX.X.windows.1
```
